## 🛠 How It Works

- User uploads a resume file or pastes plain text

- Extension sends both to an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)  
- The API returns a fully customized cover letter  
- User can view, edit, and download it

## 🧠 LLM API Integration

To use the generator, you'll need an API key from a supported language model (like OpenAI's GPT-4 or Gemini).  
The key is securely stored in local browser memory and never shared or transmitted externally.
If you dont have one you can generate a Gemini API (Limited but free).
